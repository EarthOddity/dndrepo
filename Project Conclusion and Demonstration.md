### **Finishing Touches: Bringing StudyBuddy to Life with Design and Testing** üé®üõ†Ô∏è  

As we near the final stages of building StudyBuddy, we‚Äôve focused on polishing the layout and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Here‚Äôs a peek at how we refined the design and tested the platform for a seamless experience.

---

### **Playing with the Layout and Colors** üåà  
We wanted StudyBuddy to feel inviting and easy to navigate, so we focused on enhancing the **user interface (UI)** with CSS. Key elements we worked on included:

### **Consistent Color Scheme:** We chose soft, student-friendly colors to create a comfortable browsing environment.  
 ```css
.nav-menu {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: rgb(59, 78, 127);
    background: -moz-radial-gradient(circle, rgba(58, 78, 127, 1) 0%, rgba(15, 23, 42, 1) 65%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 100%);
    background: -webkit-radial-gradient(circle, rgba(58, 78, 127, 1) 0%, rgba(15, 23, 42, 1) 65%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 100%);
    background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(58, 78, 127, 1) 0%, rgba(15, 23, 42, 1) 65%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1) 100%);
    filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr="#3a4e7f", endColorstr="#000000", GradientType=1);
    color: #e2e8f0;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 15px 20px;
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #3b82f6;
    margin-right: 40px;
}

.nav-links {
    display: flex;
    gap: 20px;
}

.nav-links a {
    color: #fcfcfc;
    text-decoration: none !important;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 8px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

.nav-links a:hover {
    color: #3b82f6;
}

.nav-links a.active {
    color: #3b82f6;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.nav-icon {
    font-size: 18px;
}
```
### **Ensuring Smooth Functionality: Testing üß™ **
Throughout development, we ran general tests on each part of the system to catch any issues early. Regular testing helped us adjust and fine-tune the system, ensuring everything runs smoothly before launch.

These final touches‚Äîboth in design and testing‚Äîensure StudyBuddy is not only functional but also enjoyable to use. We want students to feel supported and confident navigating the platform, whether they‚Äôre searching for a tutor or sharing notes.

### **Summary of our project outcome **

### **Update on Requirements **
-	As a moderator I want to be able to manage the educational institution/communities so that students can join them.
