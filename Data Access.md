### **How We Implemented the StudyBuddy Database** ðŸ’¾âœ¨  

At StudyBuddy, we needed a reliable database to store user profiles, teaching materials, and reviews. Hereâ€™s a simple look at how we set it up and made it work.

### **Step 1: Choosing the Right Tool**  
We used **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**, an **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** tool. It helps us interact with the database using C# code, so we donâ€™t have to write complex SQL queries.

### **Step 2: Creating the Database**  
EF Core allows us to define **entities** (classes) that represent our data. EF Core then converts these classes into database tables. This process is called Code Firstâ€”we define the code, and EF Core generates the database schema for us.
