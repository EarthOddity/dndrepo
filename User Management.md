### 🚀 StudyBuddy Project Update: Enhancing Security and User Experience!

We’re excited to share the latest progress on **StudyBuddy**, focusing on two key areas: security and user experience! Our team has implemented robust **authentication** and **authorization** features to ensure a secure, reliable environment for our student community. Here’s a quick look at what’s new:

---

### 🔒 **Secure Access with Authentication**
We’ve introduced an advanced **authentication system** using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. This ensures that every user—whether a student, tutor, or moderator—can securely log in and access their personalized StudyBuddy experience.

**Why it matters:**  
Students and tutors can safely create profiles, upload materials, and manage bookings, knowing their data is protected and their identities verified.

### 🛡️ **Role-Based Authorization for Enhanced Control**
Our new **role-based authorization** system controls access based on user roles:
- **Students:** Access materials, find tutors, and leave reviews.
- **Tutors:** Upload notes, manage availability, and respond to student needs.
- **Moderators:** Oversee platform activity, ensuring a safe, supportive environment by managing user access and monitoring content.

**Example:**  
Only moderators can delete inappropriate reviews, while students can filter tutors by subject, language, or availability.

Thank you for being part of the StudyBuddy journey! 🌟
