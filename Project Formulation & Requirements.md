# StudyBuddy  :sparkles:

### The Backstory  :black_nib:

As students ourselves, we noticed a need for a platform that would enable people to access teaching materials, share notes and presentations from different courses and semesters, 
facilitating the overall knowledge sharing and learning process. 

Therefore, we came up with an idea to create a student community, a common space where students can share knowledge and support each other.
